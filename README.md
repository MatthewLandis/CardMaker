# CardMaker

The greatest website to ever and will ever and should ever and could ever exist...

### Djas Directives:

- Thanks Djas :D

### Djas Suggestions:

- I think you should use kebab case (🍢) for all of your css class names. Instead of **cardContainer**, use **card-container**. I think doing so makes it easier to distinguish class names from your variables which are using camelCase.
